						Solidity is an object-oriented,
						high-level language for
						implementing smart contracts.
						Smart contracts are programs
						that govern the behavior of
						accounts within the Ethereum
						state.
					</p>
					<p>
						Solidity is a curly-bracket
						language designed to target the
						Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
						It is influenced by C++, Python,
						and JavaScript. You can find
						more details about which
						languages Solidity has been
						inspired by in the language
						influences section.
					</p>
					<p>
						Solidity is statically typed,
						supports inheritance, libraries,
						and complex user-defined types,
						among other features.

					<p>
						In this section, we will discuss
						the Solidity syntax basics. You
						can use this knowledge to build
						syntax for writing smart
						contracts using Solidity. A
						Solidity source file can contain
						any number of pragma directives,
						contract definitions, and import
						directives. Let's start with a
						simple example of a Solidity
						file:
					</p>
					<pre>
						<code>
							pragma solidity >=0.4.0 &lt;0.6.0;
							contract SimpleStorage {
							uint storedData;
							function set(uint x) public {
							storedData = x;
							}
							function get() public view returns (uint) {
							return storedData;
							}
							}
													</code>
					</pre>
					<p>
						The first line is a pragma
						directive that tells the source
						code is written for Solidity
						version 0.4.0 and newer versions
						that don't break functionality,
						excluding version 0.6.0. The
						pragma directive is always local
						to a source file and if you try
						to import another file, the
						pragma from the new file will
						not automatically apply to the
						importing file. So, if you are
						creating a pragma for a file
						that will not compile earlier
						than version 0.4.0 and it will
						also not work on a compiler,
						starting from version 0.5.0,
						will be written as:
					</p>
					<pre>
						<code>
							pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
						</code>
					</pre>
					<p>

					<p>
						With Solidity, you can create
						contracts for uses such as
						voting, crowdfunding, blind
						auctions, and multi-signature
						wallets.
					</p>
					<ol class="options">
						<li>
							Blind auctions
							<p>
								A blind auction
								is a type of
								auction where
								bidders submit
								their bids
								without knowing
								the bids of
								other
								participants.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Crowdfunding
							<p>
								Crowdfunding in
								Solidity is a
								process of
								raising funds
								for a project or
								initiative using
								Solidity
								contracts on the
								Ethereum
								blockchain. The
								process involves
								creating a
								Solidity
								contract, which
								contains rules
								for the
								crowdfunding
								campaign, such
								as a funding
								goal and a
								deadline. Users
								can then send
								Ether (the
								native
								cryptocurrency
								of the Ethereum
								blockchain) to
								the contract to
								contribute to
								the campaign.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Multi-signature wallets
							<p>
								Multi-signature
								(multisig)
								wallets in
								Solidity are
								smart contracts
								on the Ethereum
								blockchain that
								require multiple
								parties to sign
								off on a
								transaction
								before it can be
								executed. This
								is a security
								feature designed
								to protect
								against the risk
								of a single user
								or entity
								controlling all
								of the funds in
								the wallet.
							</p>
						</li>

					<p>
						Let us begin with a basic
						example that sets the value of a
						variable and exposes it for
						other contracts to access. It is
						fine if you do not understand
						everything right now, we will go
						into more details later.
					</p>
					<p class="code-header">
						Storage Example
					</p>
					<pre>
						<code>
							// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
							pragma solidity >=0.4.16 &lt;0.9.0;

							contract SimpleStorage {
								uint storedData;

								function set(uint x) public {
								storedData = x;
								}

								function get() public view returns (uint) {
								return storedData;
								}
							}
						</code>
					</pre>
					<p>
						The first line tells you that
						the source code is licensed
						under the GPL version 3.0.
						Machine-readable license
						specifiers are important in a
						setting where publishing the
						source code is the default.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next line specifies that the
						source code is written for
						Solidity version 0.4.16, or a
						newer version of the language up
						to, but not including version
						0.9.0. This is to ensure that
						the contract is not compilable
						with a new (breaking) compiler
						version, where it could behave
						differently. Pragmas are common
						instructions for compilers about
						how to treat the source code
						(e.g. pragma once).
					</p>

					<p class="code-header">
						Subcurrency Example
					</p>
					<p>
						The following contract
						implements the simplest form of
						a cryptocurrency. The contract
						allows only its creator to
						create new coins (different
						issuance schemes are possible).
						Anyone can send coins to each
						other without a need for
						registering with a username and
						password, all you need is an
						Ethereum keypair.
					</p>
					<pre>
						<code>
							// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
							pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

							contract Coin {
    							// The keyword "public" makes variables
							// accessible from other contracts
							address public minter;
							mapping(address => uint) public balances;

							// Events allow clients to react to specific
							// contract changes you declare
							event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount);

							// Constructor code is only run when the contract
							// is created
							constructor() {
								minter = msg.sender;
							}

							// Sends an amount of newly created coins to an address
							// Can only be called by the contract creator
							function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
								require(msg.sender == minter);
								balances[receiver] += amount;
							}

							// Errors allow you to provide information about
							// why an operation failed. They are returned
							// to the caller of the function.
							error InsufficientBalance(uint requested, uint available);

							// Sends an amount of existing coins
							// from any caller to an address
							function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
								if (amount > balances[msg.sender])
								revert InsufficientBalance({
									requested: amount,
									available: balances[msg.sender]
								});

								balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
